<h1>Understanding Hard-Coded Web Pages</h1>

<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, creating dynamic and interactive web pages has become the norm. However, not all web pages are created equal. Some websites still rely on a more traditional approach, where content is hard-coded directly into the page. In this article, we'll explore what it means for a web page to be hard-coded.</p>

<h2>What is a Hard-Coded Web Page?</h2>

<p>A hard-coded web page is essentially a static web page that has its content manually written into the HTML markup. Unlike dynamic websites that rely on databases, server-side scripting languages, and content management systems (CMS), hard-coded pages do not fetch or generate content on the fly. Instead, all text, images, links, and other elements are embedded directly into the HTML source code.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Hard-Coded Web Pages:</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Hard-coded pages are straightforward to create and maintain. There's no need for a backend server or database to manage content.</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Since content is embedded directly into the HTML, these pages load quickly as there's no need for database queries or server-side processing.</li>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> With fewer components and server interactions, the attack surface is reduced, making it harder for malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Below you can view the contents of the user's PHP session:</h2>

<pre><code>
    // Display user session information using $this->debug($_SESSION);
    $this->debug($_SESSION);
</code></pre>

<p>This code will display the contents of the <code>$_SESSION</code> superglobal, which stores user-specific data for the current session. It can include information like user IDs, preferences, or authentication status.</p>

<?php
    $this->debug($_SESSION);
    $this->debug($_SERVER);
    $this->debug($this);
?>
